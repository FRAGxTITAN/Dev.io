## Project Overview

**dev.io** is an open-source project aimed at providing students a collaborative platform to learn the full stack development process. The project focuses on creating a community-driven learning experience where students can contribute code, review pull requests, and participate in real-world development workflows.

This repository is structured as a multi-module project, including front-end, back-end, and database systems. Students can work on individual modules, debug issues, and add new features, simulating a professional development environment.

### Objectives
- Provide students with hands-on experience in full-stack development.
- Teach best practices in version control (Git), collaboration (PRs, Issues), and modern web technologies.
- Encourage peer code review and collaborative problem-solving.
  
## Features
- **User Authentication System**: Implemented with secure practices.
- **API Integration**: Provides a RESTful API for interaction with the front-end.
- **Database Management**: Fully-functional database using SQL/NoSQL.
- **Frontend Interface**: Built with modern JavaScript frameworks like React/Angular.
- **Collaborative Tools**: Students can work in teams, handle issues, and track progress.
